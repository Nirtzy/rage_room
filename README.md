Minimalistic project for venting out

It's annonymus chat, where you are assigned a random user name (funny one) and you are ready to send messages into chat
The whole thing will be cleared out daily leaving no trace

The backend hooks are made with Fastapi, websocket
frontend: Javascript, simple CSS
